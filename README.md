Hi I'm Jeffrey!
---

I'm a 2nd year student at UCSD interested in all things software engineering, both front-end and back-end. I have the most experience programming in Java for Android, although I'm a dilligent learner, capable of learning new technologies to develop new products! I am looking to expand my technical skills and gain valuable experiences in industry!
