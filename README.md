Hello! My name is Jeffrey Luu, a UCSD Class of 2023 Alumni who studied Human Computer Interaction and Computer Science.

Throughout my studies, I have developed a passion for creating technology that not only meets functional requirements, but also provides an exceptional user experience. By combining the technical skills I've learned with a Human Centered Design approach, I work towards finding innovative solutions to problems through the design and development process. 

Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy spending my free time reading, playing video games, and running. In fact, I am currently training to run a marathon and am excited to take on this challenge.

I am eager to explore opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge in the field of HCI and CS. Whether it's through internships or full-time positions, I am excited to contribute to projects that make a positive impact on people's lives.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. Please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or reach out to me directly. I look forward to connecting with you!
